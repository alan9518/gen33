      <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p class="textoGris">
        Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully as they govern your
        use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for
        streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and
        software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms
        (collectively, the "Spotify Service") and any music, videos, podcasts,
        audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify
        Service ("Content").
      </p>
      <p class="textoGris">
        Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the Spotify Privacy Policy and
        additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are
        made part of these Terms by this reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to
        these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use
        the Spotify Service or access any Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER
        SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY
        OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION
        THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.

      <h2 id="useSpotify">2. The Spotify Service</h2>
      <p>
        Spotify Service options We provide numerous Spotify Service options.
        Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other
        options require payment before they can be accessed ("Paid
        Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans,
        memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products
        and services. We are not responsible for the products and services
        provided by such third parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trials From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of
        Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a
        reduced rate ("Trial"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you
        agree to the Spotify Paid Subscription Terms. Third-party applications,
        devices and open source software The Spotify Service may be integrated
        with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications,
        websites, and services ("Third-Party Applications") and third-party
        personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices,
        speakers, and other devices ("Devices"). Your use of such Third-Party
        Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions,
        and policies provided to you by the applicable third party. Spotify does
        not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be
        compatible with the Spotify Service. Service limitations and
        modifications We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service
        operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio
        experience. However, Spotify reserves the right to change our Spotify
        Service offerings and their availability from time to time, without
        notice or liability to you. For example:
      </p>

      <p>
        The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to
        technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including
        those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory
        requirements. We aim to evolve and improve the Spotify Service
        constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or
        temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including
        particular functions, features, subscription plans, and promotional
        offerings). Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content
        through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may
        remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without
        notice. If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid
        Subscription that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of
        your Prepaid Period (as that term is defined in the "Payments and
        cancellations" section below), Spotify will refund you the prorated
        portion of the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such
        discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date
        in order for us to refund you. Spotify has no liability to you, nor any
        obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or
        other Spotify Service outages or failures that are caused by the actions
        of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our
        control.
